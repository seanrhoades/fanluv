She has since had 30 singles reach the Top 40 on pop charts around the world, with 22 Top 40 hits in the UK, including the Top 10 hits \"It's Oh So Quiet\", \"Army of Me\", and \"Hyperballad\". Additionally, \"Big Time Sensuality\", \"Hyperballad\" and \"I Miss You\" were number one Dance Hits in the US.

The group disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004. The group currently consists of founders Black Francis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), and David Lovering (drums). Co-founder Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) left in 2013 and was replaced by Kim Shattuck as live bass player for a few months, then by Paz Lenchantin for the band's 2014 tour. The Pixies achieved relatively modest popularity in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. The group is credited with having an influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s.", album1title: "Wave of Mutilation: Best of Pixies", album1image: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1515/fanluv/albums/pixies1.jpg", album1itunes: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wave-mutilation-best-pixies/id1025318588", album2title: "Doolittle", album2image: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1515/fanluv/albums/pixies2.jpg", album2itunes: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/doolittle/id7060469", album3title: "Surfer Rosa (Remastered)", album3image: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1515/fanluv/albums/pixies3.jpg", album3itunes: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/surfer-rosa-remastered/id1027465077", album4title: "Bossanova", album4image: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1515/fanluv/albums/pixies4.jpg", album4itunes: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bossanova/id1025319099"},
